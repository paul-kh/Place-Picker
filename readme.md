# App Overview

This Place Picker app was created for practicing React concepts, especially the useEffect Hook. The app allows users to pick a place they want to visit. The picked places will be moved to the wish list. Initially, the app is asking for the user's  location access permission so that the app will sort the places by the closest distance to the user's current location. Users can remove any picked places.
